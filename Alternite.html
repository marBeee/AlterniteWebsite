                            Alternite is a story-based puzzle-adventure game. Players control the main character and travel with him as they crack down the secrets of the mysterious "Amusement Park" they ended up in, and maybe find out something about themselves as well. 
                            <br><br>
                            Each choice the player makes will leave an impact and affect how his story turns out for him and the denizens of this world. 
                            <br><br>
                            Players may interact and enlist the help of the denizens of this world and travel with them. However, their assistance may come at a price.

                            Our primary goal is to entrance and entertain our users with the story and world we built while making sure the players walk a mile in the shoes of our main character. The game's major features are the unique choices that you make want to progress the story while knowing full well that each choice has its cost and consequences. 
                            <br><br>
                            With it, we want to make a game experience that feels real and influence our users to think about their own experiences.                        </div>

                            The impact on the community is the moral of the game and that is also our main goal. We want players to see what it feels to be in the shoes of another person troubles, and be able to reflect it on their own lives, and hopefully change some aspects from themselves for the better.                        </div>
